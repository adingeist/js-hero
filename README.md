## [Play the game here](https://adingeist.github.io/js-hero/)

JS Hero is a game developed using JavaScript that is inspired by the popular music games Rock Band and Guitar Hero. The player is presented with four columns of notes that scroll down the screen. As the notes approach a colored bar, the player must press the corresponding ASDF key on their keyboard to play the note. The objective of JS Hero is to hit as many notes as possible while maintaining a high streak multiplier and avoiding missing notes. The game
has 3 song choices:

- Rondo Alla Turca [Mozart]
- Grass Skirt Chase [Spongebob SquarePants, Composers: Sage Guyton & Jeremy Wakefield]
- Seaweed [Spongebob SquarePants, Compose: Steve Belfer]
